# CraftyBox 

Here are some components I am working on to help using Box2D in Crafty.js [web](http://craftyjs.com/) | [github](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty) engine.

It uses [Box2DWeb](http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/), which is a JavaScript port from [Box2DFlash](http://www.box2dflash.org), which is a port from the original [Box2D](http://www.gphysics.com/) physic engine written in C++.

The components are written in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), which speeds up the developing process really quick.

A compiled JS file is available.

## Components

* `Box2D`: intended to replace `2D, Physics, Gravity, Collision`.
* `Throwable`: intended to replace `Draggable`. Of course it uses `Mouse`.

## Usuage

### Initialization

You can initialize after Crafty with a set of optional options:

````javascript
Crafty.init()
Crafty.Box2D.init({gravityX:0, gravityY:0, scale:30, doSleep:true})
````

The default world has no gravity, allows sleeping, and has a SCALE of 30.

Or it will be initialized when you create a Box2D entity. You cannot set the world's properties at this point, and it will use the default values.

However you can change them through setters anytime after the world is created

````javascript
Crafty.Box2D.gravity = {x: 0, y: 10}
Crafty.Box2D.SCALE = 1
````

* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, w:w, h:h});`: A static rectangle
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, w:w, dynamic: true});`: A dynamic square
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, h:h, dynamic: true});`: also a dynamic square
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, r:r, dynamic: true});`: dynamic circle

You can also indicate `density`, `friction`, and `restitution` if you don't want the default values (1.0, 0.5, 0.2 accordingly).

`Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, w:w, h:h, density: 1.0, friction: 0.5, restitution: 0.2});`

Some shortcuts:

* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y}).rectangle(w, h);`: static rectangle
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, dynamic: true}).rectangle(w, w);`: A dynamic square
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, dynamic: true}).rectangle(w);`: also a dynamic square
* `Crafty.e("Box2D").attr({x:x, y:y, dynamic: true}).circle(r);`: dynamic circle

The Box2D world is accessible with `Crafty.Box2D.world`

See `examples` folder for more usuages.

## To Do:

* <del>Link between Crafty's 2D attributes and Box2D attributes</del>
* <del>Make objects move and rotate</del>
* Collision
* <del>`.move`, `.attach`, `.shift`, etc...</del>
* <del>`"Mouse"`, `"Draggable"`, `"Four-way"`, etc...</del>
* Throwable
